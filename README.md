<h1>Course Project: Among Us</h1>

 ### [YouTube Demonstration](https://youtu.be/7eJexJVCqJo)

<h2>Description</h2>
Implementation of a GUI programming project using Java and the Processing library. This project mainly focused on concepts like object initialization, method creation, and GUI callbacks rather than recreating the entire "Among Us" game. When running the project, users can interact with a gameplay screen, moving graphical representations of characters around to perform the game as a imposter based on a similar rule in the game "Among Us."
